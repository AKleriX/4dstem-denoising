# 4D-STEM Unsupervised Denoising (reproduction)

Code based on the 2024 paper **“Unsupervised deep denoising for four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy”** ( https://doi.org/10.1038/s41524-024-01428-x ).

This repo includes the paper model (with settings aligned to the authors’ GitHub), a lightweight U-Net–style baseline, and evaluation metrics for comparison.
